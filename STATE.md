Rules:
- Never edit or delete a past entry. Only append new ones.
- Every entry follows the exact format in `AGENTS.md` §3.1.
- To find where to resume, read from the bottom up until you find the most recent
  `IN_PROGRESS` or `BLOCKED` entry, or the most recent `DONE` entry if none are open.
- Phase/Block/Task IDs reference `docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md`.

  - N/A (this entry created the specs)
Summary: Initial full specification for the BTC Quant Workstation authored from
scratch, grounded in a direct clone and source-level analysis of
github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest (Rust core engine, Python/Numba strategy bindings,
L2/L3 market depth reconstruction, pluggable latency/queue/fee models, Rust-only
live connectors for Binance Futures/Spot and Bybit using iceoryx2 IPC, Polars-based
stats module). Covers vision, architecture, two-monitor UX spec, tech stack, engine
analysis, data pipeline, live low-latency architecture, every UI panel on both
monitors, the full analytics/investigation suite, experiment management + AI
research assistant, design system, execution-mode isolation and risk controls,
data management, cross-cutting systems (search/shortcuts/alerts/logging/states),
API and data model contracts, and a phased implementation roadmap with granular
tasks.
Deviations from spec: none (this is the spec).
Open questions for Planner: none yet — see "Open Decisions" register in
docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md §0 for decisions the Planner flagged for the
project owner (e.g. hosting/cloud provider, whether to target Binance Futures or
Bybit first for the live connector, exact GPU budget if any).
Next step: Project owner reviews docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md §0 "Open
Decisions," answers them (even briefly), then an Executor begins Phase 1, Block 1,
Task A ("Repo scaffold") as defined in docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md.

### [F.3] DONE — Secondary Monitor: Data Quality, Event Inspector, Why Investigation, Research Notes tabs
Timestamp: 2026-09-22T14:44:45Z
Agent: executor-4 (Muse Spark)
Status: DONE
Files touched:
  - frontend/src/components/secondary/DataQualityPanel.tsx
  - frontend/src/components/secondary/EventInspector.tsx
  - frontend/src/components/secondary/WhyPanel.tsx
  - frontend/src/components/secondary/NotesPanel.tsx
  - frontend/src/components/layout/SecondaryMonitor.tsx
Spec files read:
  - docs/17-frontend-first-transition-plan.md §17.2.3, §17.5
  - docs/08-secondary-monitor-components.md §8.10, §8.21, §8.22, §8.24
  - docs/09-analytics-and-investigation-suite.md §9.14
  - docs/05-engine-abstraction-and-data-pipeline.md §5.2 (quality-gate rule, via §8.10)
Summary: Added four mock-only tabs to the Secondary Monitor per Block F.3.
DataQualityPanel renders the full §8.10 report (counts, 🟢 checks, timestamp
range, source, normalization, tick/lot) with values consistent with the folded
summary in DatasetPanel, plus the §5.2 🔴-blocks-backtest gate note.
EventInspector is a full §8.21 view reading the same Sync Bus
timestampMs/selectedTradeId as ReplayPanel's folded inspector, with strategy
snapshot, mock context window (genMockTrades), and a [ view raw event ] toggle.
WhyPanel is the §8.22 navigation shell whose six questions match the §9.14
methodology table exactly, each with its evidence route and a jump button that
navigates via the Sync Bus. NotesPanel implements §8.24 (seeded attributed
notes, six attach targets wired to live workspace state, local composer).
SecondaryMonitor.tsx imports all four, extends TABS, and renders them.
Acceptance: `npm run build` (tsc -b + vite) succeeds, 65 modules transformed.
Deviations from spec: none. First draft of the four panels had unclosed JSX
tags and a mistyped notes state; caught on re-read, rewritten, then verified
by the green build above. No backend/data-shape changes (mock-only per F.1).
Open questions for Planner: none.
Next step: Human merges exec/executor-4 into main and folds this entry into
canonical STATE.md; F.4 (AI Research tab, depends on F.3) is now unblocked.
