- Never edit or delete a past entry. Only append new ones.
- Every entry follows the exact format in `AGENTS.md` §3.1.
- To find where to resume, read from the bottom up until you find the most recent
  `IN_PROGRESS` or `BLOCKED` entry, or the most recent `DONE` entry if none are open.
- Phase/Block/Task IDs reference `docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md`.

  - N/A (this entry created the specs)
Summary: Initial full specification for the BTC Quant Workstation authored from
scratch, grounded in a direct clone and source-level analysis of
github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest (Rust core engine, Python/Numba strategy bindings,
L2/L3 market depth reconstruction, pluggable latency/queue/fee models, Rust-only
live connectors for Binance Futures/Spot and Bybit using iceoryx2 IPC, Polars-based
stats module). Covers vision, architecture, two-monitor UX spec, tech stack, engine
analysis, data pipeline, live low-latency architecture, every UI panel on both
monitors, the full analytics/investigation suite, experiment management + AI
research assistant, design system, execution-mode isolation and risk controls,
data management, cross-cutting systems (search/shortcuts/alerts/logging/states),
API and data model contracts, and a phased implementation roadmap with granular
tasks.
Deviations from spec: none (this is the spec).
Open questions for Planner: none yet — see "Open Decisions" register in
docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md §0 for decisions the Planner flagged for the
project owner (e.g. hosting/cloud provider, whether to target Binance Futures or
Bybit first for the live connector, exact GPU budget if any).
Next step: Project owner reviews docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md §0 "Open
Decisions," answers them (even briefly), then an Executor begins Phase 1, Block 1,
Task A ("Repo scaffold") as defined in docs/16-implementation-roadmap.md.

### [F.5] DONE — Mock data contract audit vs docs/15 §15.5 schemas
Timestamp: 2026-09-22T15:10:00Z
Agent: executor-3 (entry written at merge time — session ended without logging, folded here per AGENTS §9.6)
Status: DONE
Files touched:
  - frontend/src/mock/mockData.ts
  - STATE.md
Spec files read:
  - docs/15-api-and-data-model-spec.md §15.5
Summary: Audited mock data types against docs/15 §15.5 and added the missing core model
interfaces (MarketEvent, DataQualityReport, BacktestRequest, BacktestProgress, Note,
AlertRecord, WorkspacePreset). Extended MockBacktestResult with the §15.5 BacktestResult
fields (jobId, experimentId, engineVersion, recorderSeriesRef, fineGrainedEventsRef,
headline) and populated them in genMockBacktestResult; attached the §15.5 Note fields to
MockStrategyState as optional (audit completeness). Generator/interface alignment done at
merge time so the branch typechecks.
Deviations from spec: Note fields added to MockStrategyState are optional additions for
audit completeness (not a §15.5 StrategyState shape) — flagged here rather than dropped.
Open questions for Planner: none.
Next step: F.5 merged to main; remaining available blocks are F.4 (build) and F.6 (design only).
